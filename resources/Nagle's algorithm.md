        std::cerr << "Failed to set TCP_NODELAY option" << std::endl;

Disabling Nagle's algorithm can provide several benefits in certain situations. Here are some advantages of disabling Nagle's algorithm:

1. Reduced latency: Nagle's algorithm introduces a small delay by waiting for more data to accumulate before sending a packet. By disabling Nagle's algorithm, data can be sent immediately, reducing the overall latency of the communication. This can be beneficial in applications that require real-time or interactive responsiveness, such as online gaming, voice/video chat, or remote control systems.

2. Improved throughput for small packets: Nagle's algorithm aims to optimize network efficiency by combining small packets into larger ones. However, in scenarios where small amounts of data need to be sent quickly, disabling Nagle's algorithm allows each small packet to be sent immediately, potentially improving throughput for such packets.

3. Better control over packet timing: Nagle's algorithm can introduce variability in packet timings, as it waits for data to accumulate before sending. Disabling Nagle's algorithm provides more control over the timing of individual packets, which can be advantageous in certain applications that require precise packet timing or synchronization.

4. Compatibility with certain protocols: Some protocols or network applications may not work optimally with Nagle's algorithm enabled. Disabling Nagle's algorithm ensures that data is sent immediately, which can be necessary for compatibility or compliance with specific protocols.

It's important to note that while disabling Nagle's algorithm can provide benefits in specific scenarios, it may also result in increased network traffic and reduced network efficiency when sending small amounts of data. Therefore, it's essential to consider the specific requirements of your application and evaluate the trade-offs before deciding to disable Nagle's algorithm.
